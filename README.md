# Mission-to-Mars

## Overview of the project


The purpose of this project if to create an APP to scrape data from website of rou mission to Mars and creat an HTML page to show our findings.

Robin’s web app is looking good and functioning well, but she wanted to add more polish to it. She had been admiring images of Mars’ hemispheres and realized that the site is scraping-friendly. She would like to adjust the current web app to include all four of the hemispheres images. This requires additional scraping code to pull the high-resolution images, updating Mongo to include the new data, and altering the design of her web app to accommodate these images.
